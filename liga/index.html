	<p><b>Goat Format END OF MATCH PROCEDURE:</b>
		“When time is called at the end of the round, the current turn of each game still in progress is completed. If a winner is not determined by the end of that turn, play will continue for an additional 3 turns, starting the count with the opponent’s turn. The play stops and the match winner is calculated using the following process:

 

If at the end of the additional 3 turns, a winner has not been determined, the player with greater life points wins that game. If life points are equal, continue play until the first change in life points. Always resolve all effects that are already on the chain before comparing the life points of the players.

 

After determining the winner of the game in progress, the player wins the match if he or she has more game wins than the opponent. If both players have an equal number of game wins, then they start a new game, which will last for a maximum of 4 turns, 2 for each player. Side decks may not be used before starting this game. At the end of the 4th turn, the player with the greatest life points wins the match. If life points are equal, continue play until the first change of in life points always resolve all effects that are already on the chain before comparing the life points of the players.

 

If players are between the games when time is called, and one player has greater game wins, that player wins the match.”
