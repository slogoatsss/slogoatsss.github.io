	<p class="block_">Dealing with Chaos Turbo</p>
	<p class="block_">Good Monday to everyone &ndash; new week, new short articles. Today I want to talk about the Chaos Turbo who is gaining in popularity and also proving itself with some strong results &ndash; namely Lukaz occupating #1 ranked spot and also achieving highest ELO of all time. It's time for you all to stop letting him get away with all this free ELO </p>
	<p class="block_">Chaos Turbo's gameplan is simple and linear &ndash; snowball the card advantage provided by tons of flips and luck-sacks with Card Destruction &amp; Charity to overwhelm the opponent. Chaos Turbo digs trough its deck quickly, thus seeing these powerful one-ofs more often, which is the entire point of the deck.</p>
	<p class="block_">How can a slow Goat Control deal with this? Where does it have an advantage? There are some key points I want to adress.</p>

</div>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Making their Chaos monsters deck is not that hard, especially when running standard version of Goat Control, which doesn't play Abyss Soldier (if you're lucky enough to always draw Serpent together with your Abyss, then bounce the Abyss back to your hand in Main Phase 2). Make sure to set your DDWL and Sangan while keeping an eye to their Graveyard. Use DDWL to crash and banish their treats, but never attack their sets with DDWL if there is a danger of her getting banished by Chaos. AKPs and TERs will naturally pay for themselves, so when they get banished it is in 1-for-1 trade, you now have a clear target and once you're done with it, you have one less Chaos to worry about.</p>

	<div class="block_1"><span class="bullet_">2.)&nbsp;</span><span class="calibre2">Hidding behind Scapegoats</span></div>
</div>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Scapegoats might just be one of the best cards against the deck. Chaos Turbo is completely unable to press for damage trough Scapegoats (with the exception of Tribe Infection Virus, who is not always played). Hold your Scapegoats for as long as possible in this matchup and ALWAYS side in the 3rd copy. Chaos Turbo has no late game and you do &ndash; Scapegoats help you get there.</p>

	<div class="block_1"><span class="bullet_">3.)&nbsp;</span><span class="calibre2">Early AKPs</span></div>
</div>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">One of the only ways for GC to quickly finish the game vs Chaos Turbo is finding and getting a quick AKP poke in. If not immeditelly answered, the AKP will (as always) quickly snowball the game into your favour. Of course, plan your Dust Tornados and revivals around AKPs if possible (as you always should).</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<div class="calibre1">
	<div class="block_1"><span class="bullet_">4.)&nbsp;</span><span class="calibre2">Usage of Dust Tornado / MST</span></div>
</div>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">One thing to know about Chaos Turbo is the fact that pretty much all backrow is chainable, with the exception of MF / TT that some players might choose to play. This means you can never hit their backrow, unless they just set it OR if your Dust Tornado / MST is the only card you control. Hitting their cards should be done prior to TER / AKP play to help them resolve. I would also advise to set MST / Dust Tornado even if they currently have zero backrow &ndash; it's probably not worth playing around Breaker in this matchup because the award of you having your turn vs 0 backrow (because you EP Dusted theirs) is higher than the risk (most common examples will be getting Tsuk-loop or AKP hit in)</p>

	<div class="block_1"><span class="bullet_">5.)&nbsp;</span><span class="calibre2">Exploiting deckbuilding problems (bonus)</span></div>
</div>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">I'm only including this section because it happened to me yesterday, playing against the man, the myth, the Lukaz himself. He goes and activates Scapegoats, I think he chained them to Mobius (I was playing some yolo Monarch build, you will see more of that in the future) and I noticed he had all 3 of his Tdrags in GY as well as his TT. He had 25 cards left in deck but I decided in that moment that I'll deck him out. He couldn't develop his field with only 1 zone free, nor could he get rid of his tokens and I wouldn't attack them. I win because of this.</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Most decks will not play Scapegoats, though.</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<div class="calibre1">
	<div class="block_1"><span class="bullet_">6.)&nbsp;</span><span class="calibre2">Side deck strategies</span></div>
</div>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Honestly, all that was said to this point is just cherry on a cake and it might help you win some games, but most of the time when you lose to Chaos Turbo you lose by getting completely and brutally stomped on. Still, it is your job to grind every game and do your best every time. GC can work miracles. But, it is our side deck's job to actually make Chaos Turbo matchup consistently lose.</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">There are two main approaches for this, and I have only tried one of them. This is the »fatigue / control« approach, as Nicey called it. You will side in cards such as Mind Control and Creature Swaps, obviously a third Scapegoat (NO EXCEPTIONS!), maybe even Exiled Force. The whole point of these cards is to help you out their Chaos (most of the times you do not want to use Mind Control on their sets, unless you know it is MoF). Your deck essentially becomes immune to their card advantage, because you have the tools to consistently out their threats, and the rest is just 1400 attack Dekos and discard traps.</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">The second approach would be the »aggro« approach, packing cards such as Trap Dustshoot, Mind Crush and KYCOO, THE GHOST DESTROYERS. I believe in the theory that states that Trap Dusthoot / Mind Crush is not effective if you can't emphasize on it (similar to the Heavy Storm theory), this is why for this side approach you will also want additional pressure, and Kycoo is the best pick for it. Downside of this approach is that these cards do not overlap to the Aggro matchup, like Creature Swap does, so you might not be able to cover all of Metagame very well, but if your goal is to defeat Chaos Turbo, you might want to try it out.</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">IN CONCLUSION</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Chaos Turbo is Chaos Turbo, and in the end, some games vs it are just unwinnable. On the good day, Chaos Turbo will win tournaments. Your job is to maximaze your % of winning, no matter the actual outcome. I hope that these guidelines help you to do so.</p>
